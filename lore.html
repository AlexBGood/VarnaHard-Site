<h1>The story of VarnaHard</h1>
<br>

<details class="left">
    <summary>What is VarnaHard?</summary>
    <ul>
<p> Originally founded in 2017 VarnaHard was just a vanilla minecraft server where local friends from the city Varna in Bulgaria can play on the same server. From 2017 to late 2019 the server had 6 different worlds each filled with nostalgia and legendary moments. In late 2019 the server was abounded due to original players leaving either cuz of boredom of the server or minecraft and the Owner (me lol) just not enjoying playing minecraft and managing the server very much (i needed a break). Well now VarnaHard returns with a new server! “So why didn’t u call it a different name cuz the server is completely new with new members that are not from Varna or Bulgaria?” Well… cuz why not, i like the name and i think it just sounds nice “VARNAHARD” yea that sounds good am I right… no? You may be wondering what the “Hard” part of VarnaHard means and I don’t have an answer to that, i think it was random but the difficulty will be on Hard so hopefully that makes it less random. If u want to record on the server or invite people you are allowed to do that (more people = good). !IMPORTANT - In order for you to play on the server you have to text your In Game Name in order for you to be whitelisted, text it on discord in  #whitelist. There are no teams by default, but if u want to i will make a Team for you and your friends. And thats enough information to know about VarnaHard now go play (if the server is online of course...)! </p>
